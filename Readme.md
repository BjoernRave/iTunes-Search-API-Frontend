This is a small project I did for a job interview.

It is made with React, React Router, Redux and Styled Components.

The usage of Redux and React Router may seem unneccessary in this case,
but it is rather to show my experience with these technologies.

For the tests I used Jest and Enzyme

The tests are not complete, if neccessary I will add more

To run the project just pull this repo and run:

`npm install`

followed by

`npm start`
